## Dev Days HOL
Dev Days provide attendees with an intense, hands-on learning experience. Spend the time exploring mobile development with sessions from Xamarin & Azure Experts, our technology partners, and members of the local developer community, then roll up your sleeves for an afternoon dedicated to diving into code.

Inside this repo you will find all of the hands on labs that you will experience at Dev Days!
