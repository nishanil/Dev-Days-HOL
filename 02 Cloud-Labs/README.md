## Dev Days HOL - Cloud

Creating a great connected experience across multiple platforms is an essential element of great mobile applications. However, what happens when there is little to no connectivity—such as on an airplane or in some foreign countries? Does your mobile app effortlessly synchronize data when the device gets back online? Although users expect and deserve this type of behavior, maintaining your own cloud backend and APIs are time-consuming and error-prone. Fear Not! With Azure Mobile Apps and it's client SDKs on iOS, Android, & Windows you can solve this problem effortlessly. 

Cloud Labs are split into two Modules -
* [Easy Tables (no code backend)] (https://github.com/nishanil/Dev-Days-HOL/tree/master/02%20Cloud-Labs/01%20EasyTables)
* [.NET Backend](https://github.com/nishanil/Dev-Days-HOL/tree/master/02%20Cloud-Labs/02%20NetBackend)

Run each of it to learn how to unleash the power of Azure Mobile Apps.
